# AnaglyphProject
A project made for a university class (January, 2018)
It is a console aplication that displays old anaglyph camera images and performs simple image transformations on them.

## Technologies
Project was created with
* c++
* Visual Studio 2019
* OpenCV 3.3

## Functionality
After running the project, two windows pop up. One that displays how to process images, alongside with the original images. The second window displays the anaglyph - an image constructed by overlaying two images, one in cyan, one in red colours to produce a 3D like effect (if wearing red-cyan 3D glasses).
The images can be moved, lightened and filtered (blur, median and gaussian filteting of OpenCV)
The operations are based on mouse and keyboard events.
